                                The Institute helps each student in exploring placement opportunities by inviting various companies for campus recruitment of students who are in the final year of the programme and are likely to graduate at the end of the academic year.<br>

                               The final placements, at the Institute, are a result of very systematic interaction with the industry and continuous career counseling of the students. Right from the beginning of the programme, students are continuously counseled with regard to his/her career aspirations and options, which in turn is vigorously followed up with the potential companies for participating in the placement programme of the Institute. This not only helps the students in getting their â€˜dreamâ€™ jobs but also assists the visiting placement companies in identifying the â€˜rightâ€™ candidate for their organization. However, the placement activity is primarily managed by the Placement Committee<br>
